October's here already; the grove already
is shaking from bare branches its last leaves;
the breath of autumn begins to ice the roadway,
the stream still rushes gurgling past the mill,
but the mill pond is frozen; my sporting neighbour
hurries off with his pack to the far fields.
The winter corn suffers his boisterous pleasure,
his yelping hounds disturb the forest's slumber.
